## No Tomato Tomato Sauce
Quick and easy to make and you won't believe it's not really tomatoes! You can use this for spaghetti sauce, chili base or pizza sauce or whatever sauce!

Serves â€“ 

### Ingredients
- 2 1/2 cups steamed carrots
- 1/3 cup steamed beets
- 2/3 cup water
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon Basil (leave out for Chili)
- 1/2 teaspoon Onion Powder
- 1/8 teaspoon Oregano
- 3/4 cup chopped cooked onions (I use dried flakes but not this much)

### Instructions

- Chop steam beets and carrots. Refrigerate to cool.
- Brown onion & garlic together.
- Measure all ingredients into a blender and blend until smooth.
- Add cooked ground meat or meatballs for spaghetti sauce. Or use as is for pizza sauce.
