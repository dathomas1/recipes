- 1 tsp [thyme](http://amzn.to/1fzvitP)
- 1 tsp [dill](http://amzn.to/1eGMGN7)
- 3 [whole bay leaves](http://amzn.to/1fzwfCk)

Instructions

1. Start off with 2 tablespoons of coconut oil in a soup pot heating up on a medium flame.
2. Throw in onions and crushed garlic to cook until fragrant.
3. Then throw in chopped carrots and celery. Let these veggies cook down until tender.
4. Pour in 1 quart of your broth of choice, water and tomato sauce.
5. Let this come to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Allow the veggies and broth to simmer for about 30 minutes. You may season in this step as well.
6. While the soup is simmering, start to peel your shrimp, if unpeeled.
7. Cut your calamari tubes into about 1/2 inch pieces and let them sit in a bowl with lemon juice. The lemon juice will help prevent them turning rubbery if cooked too long.
8. Chop up mushrooms and add them to the soup after it’s been simmering for 30 minutes. Add coconut cream, if using, at this stage as well. Make sure the soup returns to a simmer if cooled off too much by the cream.
9. When the mushrooms have been cooking for about 10 minutes, add in wild caught cod and let it cook for about 10 minutes as well.
10. Take a wooden spoon and break the fish down in the pot into smaller pieces.
11. After the fish is finished cooking, add scallops to simmer.
12. To cook the shrimp, make sure the water is simmering and turn up the heat just a little bit. Add them in at the same time and let them cook for bout 3 minutes.
13. After 3 minutes, add in the calamari (don’t add the lemon juice) to the soup and let the entire soup cook for another 2 minutes. If you let it cook for longer, the calamari may become rubbery and the shrimp hard.
14. Turn off the flame and take the pot off the heat. Add in the juice of 1 lime, or more to taste. Enjoy with chopped green onion and fresh parsley (don’t forget to remove the bay leaves)!

### Notes
One thing to keep in mind is to make sure if you’re using fresh dill, basil or parsley, to add them in at the last 5 minutes of cooking. These fresh herbs are delicate and can break down and lose flavor if cooked too long. You can sprinkle them on at the very end just to be extra safe, preserving their great taste for sure!
