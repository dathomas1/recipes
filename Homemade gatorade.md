## Orange Twist Electrolyte Drink (Recipe #2)

This easy and delicious electrolyte sports drink recipe supports optimal hydration by replacing vital minerals and electrolytes.

I've aimed for a 6% solution, which is 6 grams of carbohydrates per 100ml of liquid. It's within the 6-8% recommended by the [USADA](https://www.usada.org/wp-content/uploads/Nutrition-Guide.pdf) for providing energy (and flavor).

It also contains the minimum amount of sodium and a whopping 391 mg of potassium. Makes approximately 24 ounces, and a serving is 8 ounces.

### Ingredients

- 2 cups water
- ¾ cup fresh orange juice
- ¼ cup fresh lemon juice
- ⅛ rounded tsp [Himalayan pink salt](https://www.amazon.com/Terrasoul-Superfoods-Himalayan-Pounds-Extra-Fine/dp/B071HCL4Z9/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=Himalayan+salt+fine&qid=1595801976&sr=8-8&linkCode=ll1&tag=mommypotamus-20&linkId=3758ac023ca053e0811dcf1e15bcebe8&language=en_US)
- 1 tbsp [raw honey](https://www.amazon.com/USDA-Organic-Mountain-Ridge-Honey/dp/B01MRLMOIB/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=organic+raw+honey&qid=1561323538&s=grocery&sr=1-12&linkCode=ll1&tag=mommypotamus-20&linkId=c81e5a67f7e9a9ad76d28480f08f1c10&language=en_US)
